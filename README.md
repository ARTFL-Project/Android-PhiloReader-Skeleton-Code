# Android-PhiloReader-Skeleton-Code
This Android java code is intended to demonstrate the PhiloLogic4 API in action. Included are the MainActivity class and two async task classes that send query urls to and receive search result objects (JSON) from a PhiloLogic4 database running on the ARTFL Project's servers at the University of Chicago. The apps are compiled against SDK version 22;  minimum SDK version 14.

A primary goal of the PhiloLogic4 project has been to allow ARTFL -- or any digital humanities group using this software -- to develop a variety of results display and user interfaces with ease. PhiloReader Apps exemplify this fundamental design goal. They take advantage of PhiloLogic4â€™s simple set of query parameters and flexible results object formatting to enable text search and retrieval on handheld devices.
